Simply run:

`python kmeans.py <bank/eyes>` to run clustering using kmeans, including feature transformation

`python emax.py <bank/eyes>` to run clustering using expectation maximization, including feature transformation

`python reduce.py <bank/eyes>` to run feature transformation alone

`python learn.py <bank/eyes>` to train and test a neural network using the various feature transformation algorithms

`python test.py <bank/eyes` to test a specific combination of parameters


Each script has multiple capabilities, each of which is accessed through a series of commenting and uncommenting
(for instance, uncommenting whichever feature transformer you want to use).
